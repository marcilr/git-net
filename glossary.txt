ASN - Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is a standard and notation that
  describes rules and structures for representing, encoding, transmitting, and
  decoding data in telecommunications and computer networking.  The formal
  rules enable representation of objects that are independent of
  machine-specific encoding techniques.  Formal notation makes it possible to
  automate the task of validating whether a specific instance of data
  representation abides by the specifications.  In other words, software tools
  can be used for the validation.[1]

DSSS - direct-sequence spread spectrum - Acronym for direct-sequence spread
  spectrum.  DSSS is one of two types of spread spectrum radio, the other
  being frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS).  DSSS is a transmission
  technology used in LAWNtransmissions where a data signal at the sending
  station is combined with a higher data rate bit sequence, or chipping code,
  that divides the user data according to a spreading ratio.  The chipping
  code is a redundant bit pattern for each bit that is transmitted, which
  increases the signal's resistance to interference.  If one or more bits in
  the pattern are damaged during transmission, the original data can be
  recovered due to the redundancy of the transmission.

Ethernet - A local-area network (LAN) architecture developed by Xerox
  Corporation in cooperation with DEC and Intel in 1976.  Ethernet uses a bus
  or star topology and supports data transfer rates of 10 Mbps.  The Ethernet
  specification served as the basis for the IEEE 802.3 standard, which
  specifies the physical and lower software layers.  Ethernet uses the CSMA/CD
  access method to handle simultaneous demands.  It is one of the most widely
  implemented LAN standards.

  A newer version of Ethernet, called 100Base-T (or Fast Ethernet), supports
  data transfer rates of 100 Mbps.  And the newest version, Gigabit Ethernet
  supports data rates of 1 gigabit (1,000 megabits) per second.

FHSS - frequency-hopping spread spectrum - Acronym for frequency-hopping
  spread spectrum.  FHSS is one of two types of spread spectrum radio, the
  other being direct-sequence spread spectrum.  FHSS is a transmission
  technology used in LAWNtransmissions where the data signal is modulated with
  a narrowband carrier signal that "hops" in a random but predictable sequence
  from frequency to frequency as a function of time over a wide band of
  frequencies.  The signal energy is spread in time domain rather than
  chopping each bit into small pieces in the frequency domain.  This technique
  reduces interference because a signal from a narrowband system will only
  affect the spread spectrum signal if both are transmitting at the same
  frequency at the same time.  If synchronized properly, a single logical
  channel is maintained.

  The transmission frequencies are determined by a spreading, or hopping,
  code.  The receiver must be set to the same hopping code and must listen to
  the incoming signal at the right time and correct frequency in order to
  properly receive the signal.  Current FCC regulations require manufacturers
  to use 75 or more frequencies per transmission channel with a maximum dwell
  time (the time spent at a particular frequency during any single hop) of 400
  ms.

HomePlug - HomePlug is the name of the specification that defines the home
  networking technology that connects devices to each other through the power
  lines in a home (see power line networking).  HomePlug certified products
  connect PCs and other devices that use Ethernet, USB and 802.11 Wi-Fi
  technologies to the power line via a HomePlug bridge or adapter.  Some
  products have HomePlug technology built-in.

  HomePlug uses Intellon's PowerPacket[1] solution as its baseline technology.
  Intellon created and patented the baseline technology for the HomePlug 1.0
  standard and introduced the first HomePlug 1.0-based IC in June 2001.

OFDM - (pronounced as separate letters) Short for Orthogonal Frequency
  Division Multiplexing, an FDM modulation technique for transmitting large
  amounts of digital data over a radio wave.  OFDM works by splitting the
  radio signal into multiple smaller sub-signals that are then transmitted
  simultaneously at different frequencies to the receiver. OFDM reduces the
  amount of crosstalk in signal transmissions. 802.11a WLAN, 802.16 and WiMAX
  technologies use OFDM.

  Compare with FHSS and DSSS.

OSI - Open System Interconnection, is a networking model comprised of seven 
  'layers'.  It's a controlled hierarchy where information is passed from one
  layer to the next creating a blueprint for how information is passed from
  physical electrical impulses all the way to applications.

  This standard is a guide that allows engineers to keep communications
  organized.

PAT - Port Address Translation (PAT), is an extension to network address
  translation (NAT) that permits multiple devices on a local area network
  (LAN) to be mapped to a single public IP address.  The goal of PAT is to
  conserve IP addresses.

power line Ethernet bridge - A power line Ethernet bridge is a HomePlug device
  used to extend a LAN into a separate room using the existing electrical
  system in the building.  An Ethernet cable from the network router is
  plugged into a bridge, which plugs into an AC wall outlet.  In a separate
  room, a second bridge plugs into the wall outlet to provide an Ethernet port
  for the computer.  Power line Ethernet bridges are a type of HomePlug[2] device.

PowerPacket - PowerPacket technology uses the same power line that provides
  electricity to your computer to network it to other computers in your home
  or office.  PowerPacket uses Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
  (OFDM) to handle high-speed data transmission between computers.  Electrical
  wires in a home are difficult to use for deploying a network as electrical
  wires are always in a state of flux.  OFDM can detect changes within the
  power line and maintain network communication even during power fluctuations.
  PowerPacket is designed to seamlessly coexist with existing home networking
  technology, including HomePNA, 802.11b and HomeRF, and can also work with
  older home power line technologies.  PowerPacket was developed by Intellon
  and is used as the baseline technology for the HomePlug specification.

PPPoE - Acronym for Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet.  PPPoE relies on
  two widely accepted standards: PPP and Ethernet.  PPPoE is a specification
  for connecting the users on an Ethernet to the Internet through a common
  broadband medium, such as a single DSL line, wireless device or cable modem.
  All the users over the Ethernet share a common connection, so the Ethernet
  principles supporting multiple users in a LAN combine with the principles of
  PPP, which apply to serial connections.
